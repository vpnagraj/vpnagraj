	Title: A Mission Focused Approach to Liaison Services Data Collection (view slides)

	Author(s): Bart Ragon, MLIS; Megan Nunemaker, MLIS; VP Nagraj

	Abstract:

	Objectives: Health sciences libraries support organizational missions related to clinical care, research, education, and outreach. The University of Virginia Health Sciences Library developed a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system allowing services to be tracked to the four core missions. This paper will discuss the process of migrating to the CRM and the benefits gained from new data mining capabilities.

	Methods: During the fall of 2013 a review of CRM software was conducted by the library to determine the best solution for gathering and reporting statistics. A functional requirements list was created to assist in software evaluation and included criteria like the ability to capture liaison activities, linking service interactions to the four core missions, report generation, and ease of use. After a 6 months pilot period descriptive statistics were generated using SPSS for individual liaisons, departments, and the library as a whole. The system was then re-evaluated for functionality and adjustments were made based on user feedback and the need for data standardization. Once this was achieved, generation of descriptive statistics was migrated to the R programming language to increase the ability to produce on demand reports.

The course will provide basic grounding in concepts such as training and tests sets, overfitting, and error rates. The course will also introduce a range of model based and algorithmic machine learning methods including regression, classification trees, Naive Bayes, and random forests. The course will cover the complete process of building prediction functions including data collection, feature creation, algorithms, and evaluation.*

**Regression Models — Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization** (Coursera — Summer 2015)

*Linear models, as their name implies, relates an outcome to a set of predictors of interest using linear assumptions.  Regression models, a subset of linear models, are the most important statistical analysis tool in a data scientist’s toolkit. This course covers regression analysis, least squares and inference using regression models. Special cases of the regression model, ANOVA and ANCOVA will be covered as well. Analysis of residuals and variability will be investigated. The course will cover modern thinking on model selection and novel uses of regression models including scatterplot smoothing.*

**Statistical Inference — Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization** (Coursera — Summer 2015)

*Statistical inference is the process of drawing conclusions about populations or scientific truths from data. There are many modes of performing inference including statistical modeling, data oriented strategies and explicit use of designs and randomization in analyses. Furthermore, there are broad theories (frequentists, Bayesian, likelihood, design based, …) and numerous complexities (missing data, observed and unobserved confounding, biases) for performing inference. A practitioner can often be left in a debilitating maze of techniques, philosophies and nuance. This course presents the fundamentals of inference in a practical approach for getting things done. After taking this course, students will understand the broad directions of statistical inference and use this information for making informed choices in analyzing data.*

**Reproducible Research — Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization** (Coursera — Fall 2014)

This course focuses on the concepts and tools behind reporting modern data analyses in a reproducible manner. Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them.  The need for reproducibility is increasing dramatically as data analyses become more complex, involving larger datasets and more sophisticated computations. Reproducibility allows for people to focus on the actual content of a data analysis, rather than on superficial details reported in a written summary. In addition, reproducibility makes an analysis more useful to others because the data and code that actually conducted the analysis are available. This course will focus on literate statistical analysis tools which allow one to publish data analyses in a single document that allows others to easily execute the same analysis to obtain the same results.

**Exploratory Data Analysis — Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization** (Coursera — Fall 2014)

This course covers the essential exploratory techniques for summarizing data. These techniques are typically applied before formal modeling commences and can help inform the development of more complex statistical models. Exploratory techniques are also important for eliminating or sharpening potential hypotheses about the world that can be addressed by the data. We will cover in detail the plotting systems in R as well as some of the basic principles of constructing data graphics. We will also cover some of the common multivariate statistical techniques used to visualize high-dimensional data.

**Getting And Cleaning Data — Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization** (Coursera — Fall 2014)

Before you can work with data you have to get some. This course will cover the basic ways that data can be obtained.
